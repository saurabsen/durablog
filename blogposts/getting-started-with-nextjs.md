Next.js is a React framework that provides a set of tools and conventions for building server-rendered React applications. Developed by Vercel, Next.js makes it simple to create static and dynamic web applications with minimal setup.

## Key Features

- **Static Site Generation (SSG):** Generates HTML at build time, allowing for fast page loads.
- **API Routes:** Create backend endpoints within your Next.js application, simplifying the development process.
- **Automatic Code Splitting:** Only loads the necessary JavaScript for the current page, enhancing performance.
- **File-System Routing:** Simplifies navigation with a straightforward file-based routing system.
